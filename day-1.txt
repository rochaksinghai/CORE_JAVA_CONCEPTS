============================================================
1. PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE BASICS
============================================================

[A] PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
    - Definition: A set of instructions used to talk to computers.
    - Analogy: Like using English or Hindi to communicate with humans.

[B] HIGH-LEVEL VS. LOW-LEVEL
    - High-Level (e.g., Java, Python):
      * Uses English words (if, while, print).
      * Easy for humans to read and write.
    - Low-Level (e.g., Assembly, Binary):
      * Uses machine codes (0s and 1s) or hardware instructions.
      * Very fast but hard for humans to understand.

[C] STRUCTURED PROGRAMMING
    - Definition: Code is organized into logical blocks (loops, if-else).
    - Benefit: Prevents messy "spaghetti code."

[D] STATIC VS. DYNAMIC LANGUAGES
    - Static (Java):
      * STRICT. You must define the type of data first (e.g., int x = 5).
      * Errors are caught BEFORE running the app (Compile time).
    - Dynamic (Python, JS):
      * FLEXIBLE. You can change data types anytime.
      * Errors are caught WHILE running the app (Runtime).

[E] MARKUP LANGUAGES (e.g., HTML, XML)
    - Note: These are NOT programming languages.
    - Usage: Used for formatting text or structure, not for logic/math.

============================================================
2. THE JAVA ECOSYSTEM (JDK, JRE, JVM)
============================================================

Imagine a Restaurant:

[A] JDK (Java Development Kit) -> "THE KITCHEN"
    - Who needs it: Developers (Programmers).
    - Contains: Tools to write code (Compiler) + Environment to run it (JRE).

[B] JRE (Java Runtime Environment) -> "THE DINING HALL"
    - Who needs it: Users (Clients).
    - Contains: Just enough libraries to RUN the program. You cannot write code here.

[C] JVM (Java Virtual Machine) -> "THE CHEF"
    - Role: The Translator.
    - Function: Converts Java Bytecode into instructions the specific computer (Windows/Mac) understands.
    - Key Feature: Makes Java "Platform Independent" (Write Once, Run Anywhere).

============================================================
3. HOW JAVA RUNS CODE
============================================================

[A] COMPILER (javac)
    - Role: Translates human code (.java) into Bytecode (.class).
    - Why: The computer cannot read English; it needs Bytecode.

[B] JIT COMPILER (Just-In-Time)
    - Role: Performance Booster.
    - How: Instead of reading line-by-line, it identifies frequently used code ("hotspots") and compiles them instantly into native machine code for speed.

============================================================
4. MEMORY MANAGEMENT
============================================================

[A] STACK MEMORY
    - Analogy: A sticky-note pad.
    - Usage: Stores temporary variables and method calls.
    - Behavior: Last-In, First-Out (LIFO). Very fast, automatically cleared when a method ends.

[B] HEAP MEMORY
    - Analogy: A large storage warehouse.
    - Usage: Stores Objects (new Student(), new String()).
    - Behavior: Objects stay here until they are destroyed. Slower than Stack but holds more data.

[C] GARBAGE COLLECTION (GC)
    - Analogy: Automatic Cleaning Crew.
    - Function: You do not need to delete memory manually. The GC looks at Heap memory, finds unused objects, and deletes them to free up space.

============================================================
5. THE CLASS LOADER (IN BRIEF)
============================================================

[A] DEFINITION
    - A subsystem of the JVM responsible for loading .class files into memory.

[B] KEY CONCEPT: "DYNAMIC LOADING"
    - The JVM does not load all files at once.
    - It acts like a Librarian: It fetches a file from the disk only when the program actually asks for it.

[C] THE HIERARCHY (DELEGATION MODEL)
    1. Bootstrap Class Loader (Grandparent):
       - Loads core Java libraries (String, System, etc.).
    2. Extension Class Loader (Parent):
       - Loads extra standard libraries.
    3. Application Class Loader (Child):
       - Loads the code YOU wrote.

    * Note: When a class is needed, the Child asks the Parent, who asks the Grandparent.

============================================================
6. CORE CONCEPTS
============================================================

[A] MULTITHREADING
    - Definition: Doing multiple things at the same time.
    - Example: Downloading a file in the background while keeping the app screen responsive.

[B] DATATYPES
    - Primitive (e.g., int, boolean):
      * Stores the ACTUAL value (e.g., 10, true).
      * Lives in the Stack.
    - Non-Primitive (e.g., String, Array, Class):
      * Stores a REFERENCE (address) to the object.
      * The reference lives in the Stack, but the data lives in the Heap.
